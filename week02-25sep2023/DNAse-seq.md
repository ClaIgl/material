# DNAse-seq
DNase-seq, short for DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing, is a method used to identify regions of the genome that are accessible to the protein DNase I. These accessible regions often correspond to regulatory elements, such as promoters, enhancers, and insulators, which play crucial roles in gene expression. By sequencing the DNA fragments that are cleaved by DNase I, researchers can create a genome-wide map of these regulatory elements, providing insights into the regulatory landscape of a cell.
