### Methyl-Seq Technology


### Short introduction

Also referred to as bisulfite sequencing this method is used to study methylation patterns of DNA. Here unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracil during library preparation and identified as thymine in the sequencing data. This can then be used to determine the percentage of methylated cytosines.
