# ATAC-seq Week 2 Exercise Part B


## What is ATAC-seq
ATAC-seq is an abbreviation for 'Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with sequencing,' a molecular biology technique employed to evaluate the accessibility of chromatin throughout the entire genome. Chromatin accessibility pertains to the degree of compaction of DNA within the cell nucleus. Regions characterized by open or accessible chromatin are more prone to transcription into RNA and subsequent gene expression.
By analyzing what regions are open, itâ€™s possible to understand what areas of the DNA are influencing the cell state, to study gene regulation, cell differentiation, and development, as well as to identify genetic risk factors for disease.

## How does ATAC-seq work

## Interesting applications

## Benefits compared to other techniques

| Feature | ATAC-seq | ChIP-seq | RNA-seq |
|---|---|---|---|
| Input material requirement | Lower | Higher | Lower |
| Assay time | Shorter | Longer | Longer |
| Library preparation | In situ | Nuclei isolation required | RNA extraction required |
| Applicability to fresh-frozen tissue | Yes | Yes (with considerations) | Yes |
| Technical difficulty | Easier | More difficult | More difficult |
| What it measures | Chromatin accessibility | Protein-DNA binding | Gene expression |


## Summary
ATAC-seq is an abbreviation for 'Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with sequencing,' a molecular biology technique employed to evaluate the accessibility of chromatin throughout the entire genome. In this assay, next-generation sequencing (NGS) adapters are loaded onto the transposase, which allows simultaneous fragmentation of chromatin and integration of those adapters into open chromatin regions. The generated library can be sequenced by NGS and thus bioinformatic methods can be used to analyze the regions of the genome with open or accessible chromatin.
