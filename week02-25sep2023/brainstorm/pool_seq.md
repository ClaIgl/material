## Brief description
Pool-seq is a cost-effective RNA-seq (15$/sample) method that drew inspiration from RNA-seq methods like Drop-seq, SMART-seq and TruSeq. It works by generating dual indexed cDNA samples with i5 and i7 primers where the former serves as pool index and the latter as sample index within the pool. The barcoded cDNA can then be further used by NGS methods such as Illumina.
