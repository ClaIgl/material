## Brief description:

-   Pool-seq is a low-cost sequencing approach used in population genetics and epidemiological studies in order to circumvent the high costs of NGS per individual for large population sizes.

-   The first step is to pool together the genomic DNA from multiple individuals in a population, and to then perform Illumina sequencing of many such pools in a multiplexed fashion, thereby increasing the total number of individuals sequenced [[1]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002487#s4).

-   Even though it apparently treats multiple individuals as the same sample, accurate estimation of rare allele frequencies (AF) in the population (which is crucial on a population scale) is enabled by using appropriate filters. Thus, Pool-seq AFs are as accurate as those obtained from individual sequencing [[2]](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep33735).
